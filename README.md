# timetable
This is a simple python app that exports today's Namaaz(salaat) timetable as JSON and renders HTML template using Flask.
This is my first python development due to my inexperiance at the time I assume it could have been coded much simpler.
Please free to contribute to this repository or fork it for your own development.

#To use this code
1- simply clone it to your server using 'git clone'
2- create your own sqlite prayter time database and rename it to timetable.db
3- create a virtual environment in the directory - you would need to have root ssh access to your server
4- Read online about how to deploy Flask/Flask restless
